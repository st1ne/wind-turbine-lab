# Electric Motor Lab: build TODO

Companion to `TECH_SPEC.md` (§ numbers refer to it). Work top to bottom: each phase ends with a **Done when** check and a ready-to-paste **Opus prompt**. Keep `TECH_SPEC.md` and `TODO.md` in the repo root and attach them to every prompt.

**Ground rules for every phase**
- Everything in English: code, comments, UI copy, commits.
- Physics first, pixels second. No number goes on screen unless it comes from `src/physics`.
- No Tesla logos, wordmarks or product replicas (§ brand rule). The drive unit is generic.
- One phase per Opus session (best in Claude Code, so it can run tests itself). Commit after each phase: `feat(phase-N): …`.
- After each phase, run `npm run dev`, click through it yourself, and tick the boxes.

Legend: `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · ★ = critical for the wow moments

**Done when:** a dark page with the token background; `npm test` runs; lint clean.

**Opus prompt**
```
You are building "Electric Motor Lab" from TECH_SPEC.md (attached). Do Phase 0 from TODO.md only:
scaffold Vite + strict TypeScript, install three (pin exact version), vitest, eslint, prettier, tsx.
Create the full folder tree from §13.2 with typed stub modules (export the public signatures, throw "not implemented").
Add the CSS tokens from §3.2 (including the phase A/B/C colors), fonts, index.html structure, npm scripts, README.
All code and comments in English. Output every file in full. Do not start physics or 3D yet.
```

## Phase 1: Physics reference and tuning ★  (≈ 4–5 h)

This is the most important phase. First a Python reference (easy to iterate), then tune, then freeze.

### 1.1 Python reference (`reference/motor_model_reference.py`)
- [x] IPM dq model (§6.2): flux, voltage, torque, current and voltage limits
- [x] IM rotor-flux-oriented model (§6.3): torque, slip, voltage, rotor current
- [x] Loss model (§6.4): stator copper with temperature + AC factor, rotor copper, iron (k_h, k_e), magnet eddy, mechanical, inverter, gearbox
- [x] Minimum-loss operating-point solver for (rpm, T_cmd) for both motors, with envelopes T_max(rpm) and T_min(rpm)
- [x] Vehicle + battery + driver + thermal (§6.8–6.10); scenarios: launch, cruise 110, top speed, regen 0.25 g, coast, 10× launch derate
- [x] Print a report: envelope table, efficiency at key points, slip, spin losses at 100 km/h, 0–100 time, top speed, kWh/100 km

### 1.2 Tuning
- [x] Tune p/ψ_m/L_d/L_q/R_s/I_max (IPM) and L_m/L_ls/L_lr/R_s/R_r/I_max (IM), plus the loss coefficients, until **every §7.1 target is within ±5 %**
- [x] Check `ψ_m / L_d < I_max` (infinite-speed field weakening)
- [x] Freeze the parameters; write the §7.4 frozen reference table (both motors) into TECH_SPEC.md
- [x] Export `reference/vectors.json` (the operating points + scenario results) for the TS tests

### 1.3 TypeScript port
- [x] `config/motor.ts`, `vehicle.ts`, `battery.ts`, `thermal.ts`: frozen parameters
- [x] `physics/pmsm.ts`, `induction.ts`, `losses.ts`, `operatingPoint.ts`, `envelope.ts`: a line-by-line port
- [x] `scripts/build-maps.ts` → `src/physics/maps.generated.json` (65 speeds × 169 torques × 2 motors, float32, 4 significant digits); `physics/maps.ts` bilinear lookup + clamp
- [x] `physics/kinematics.ts`: display-time angles, phase currents, field angle, load angle, Auto slow-mo (§6.6)

### 1.4 Tests (Vitest)
- [x] `invariants.test.ts`: all 10 invariants from §7.2

- [x] `reference.test.ts`: the TS matches `reference/vectors.json` (currents ±1 A, efficiency ±0.1 pp, envelope ±1 N·m)
- [x] `scenarios.test.ts`: §7.3 (launch, regen, derate)
- [x] `fuzz.test.ts`: 10k random inputs → finite outputs

**Done when:** `npm test` is green; the Python report and the TS maps agree; TECH_SPEC §7.4 is filled in.

**Opus prompt (Python part)**
```
Phase 1.1–1.2 of TODO.md. Write reference/motor_model_reference.py (numpy only) implementing TECH_SPEC.md §6.2–6.10
exactly: IPM dq model, induction machine with rotor-flux orientation, the full loss model, a minimum-loss operating-point
solver with current and voltage limits, torque envelopes, vehicle/battery/driver/thermal models and the scenarios.
Then TUNE the starting parameters until every target in §7.1 is within ±5 % — iterate, run it, show the report each time.
Freeze the parameters, print the §7.4 table and write reference/vectors.json. Comments in English.
```

**Opus prompt (TS part)**
```
Phase 1.3–1.4 of TODO.md. Port reference/motor_model_reference.py line by line into src/physics (pure TS, no three.js),
using the frozen parameters. Add scripts/build-maps.ts, maps lookup, kinematics (§6.6), PWM (§6.7), vehicle, driver
presets, battery, thermal, fixed-step sim and regime classification. Write the Vitest suites from Phase 1.4.

- [x] Dev overlay: snapshot + display angles JSON

**Done when:** Launch at ×1000 shows the rotor and field accelerating smoothly while the car does a real-time 0–100; freeze stops the field but the km/h keeps climbing.

- [ ] Label visibility per view; hotkey V; URL `view`
- [ ] Cutaway is the default view

**Done when:** no pops, no cap gaps, the rotor and field animate during transitions.

---

## Phase 8: Field visuals ★★  (≈ 4–5 h)

The heart of the page. Take your time here.

- [ ] Coil glow per phase from `ia/ib/ic` (emissive in phase color ∝ |i|); end-turn particles flow direction by sign
- [ ] `fieldArrow.ts`: violet arrow in the air-gap plane at `θ_field / p`, length ∝ |B̂|
- [ ] `gapArrows.ts`: 54 instanced arrows scaled by `B(φ)` in the vertex shader
- [ ] `fluxLines.ts`: 2p bundles × 6 ribbons from a precomputed arc template, rotated with the field (stylized, §9)
- [ ] `hologram.ts`: enlarged transparent stator cross-section above the motor (field lens) with its own arrow + rotor marker
- [ ] Rotor d-axis arrow (white) + load-angle arc between rotor and field, with a label
- [ ] Induction: bar glow ∝ bar current; the field gains laps on the rotor; lap counter (§10.2)
- [ ] "Only phase A" toggle (key O): a pulsating field instead of a rotating one (§10.1)
- [ ] QA: at ×1000 the brightest coil, the field arrow and the scope cursor are aligned (screen-record and step through frames)

**Done when:** a non-engineer watching for 10 s at ×1000 can say "the three coils take turns and the arrow goes round, and the rotor follows it". In Induction they can see the arrow pulling ahead.

**Opus prompt**
```
Phase 8 of TODO.md: the field visuals per TECH_SPEC.md §6.6, §9 (Field row) and §10.1–10.2. This is the hero effect.
Drive everything from DisplayAngles (thetaCurrent, thetaField, thetaMech, thetaSync, ia/ib/ic).
Coil emissive per phase, field arrow, 54 instanced air-gap arrows sized by B(phi) in the vertex shader, stylized flux-line
ribbons rotating with the field, a floating hologram cross-section, a load-angle arc, induction bar glow and lap counter,
and an "only phase A" toggle that shows a pulsating (not rotating) field. Everything must stay phase-locked with the scope chart.
```

---

## Phase 9: Power and heat visuals  (≈ 3 h)

- [ ] `heat.ts`: temperature color ramp on windings and magnets/cage (40 → 160 °C); derate warning
- [ ] `oilJets.ts`: particles from the hollow shaft onto the end turns
- [ ] Follow modes (`follow.ts`): `uDim` transitions, forced chart per mode (§9)

**Done when:** in Regen the pulses flip within 200 ms; 10 repeated launches visibly heat the windings and trigger DERATE.

---

## Phase 10: Charts and gauges  (≈ 3 h)

- [ ] `chartBase.ts`: DPR canvas, axes, grid, mono ticks, theme colors
- [ ] `torqueSpeedMap.ts`: drive and regen envelopes, efficiency heat map with contours (from the build-time maps), base-speed marker, live dot with 5 s trail, cross-fade on motor swap

- [ ] All labels from the §3.7 table with live values and mode/view visibility

---

## Phase 12: Tour, chips, URL, share  (≈ 2 h)

- [ ] `tour/steps.ts` + `tour.ts`: 6 steps (§11), caption bar, Resume pill
- [ ] `chips.ts`: 4 camera chips (§3.8)
- [ ] `urlState.ts` (§16), `share.ts`
- [ ] `{BRAND}` and `{HANDLE}` in one config file

**Done when:** the tour runs end to end in ≈ 50 s; a shared URL restores motor, view, follow, slow-mo and camera.

---

## Phase 13: Audio  (≈ 1.5 h)

- [ ] WebAudio graph from §12: motor whine (6·f_e and 12·f_e harmonics), inverter hiss, gear mesh whine, roller rumble, limiter
- [ ] Audio follows real time (not slow-mo); starts after a user gesture; off by default; mute state in the URL

---

## Phase 14: Polish ★  (≈ 3 h)

- [ ] Motion pass (§4.6); no easing on physics-driven motion
- [ ] Bloom/exposure: only coils, field arrow, flux lines, LEDs and screens glow
- [ ] Typography: tabular numbers, units `rpm`, `N·m`, `kW`, `A pk`, `V`, `°C`, `km/h`
- [ ] Copy pass at edge cases: 0 km/h, top speed, regen at 5 km/h, derate, coast in both motors
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison with the reference screenshots (panel spacing, pills, label style, headline scale)

---

## Phase 15: Performance, mobile, accessibility  (≈ 3 h)

- [ ] Measure against §14; fix the top offenders; adaptive DPR; lazy maps with the analytic fallback
- [ ] Mobile bottom sheet with throttle, brake and presets in the peek (§15)
- [ ] Reduced motion; flicker ≤ 3 Hz; keyboard-only and screen-reader passes; contrast
- [ ] Test on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, iOS Safari, Android Chrome

---

## Phase 16: QA and launch  (≈ 2 h)

- [ ] Run the §18 acceptance checklist, item by item
- [ ] Traceability table in README: every on-screen number → physics function
- [ ] Brand check: no logos, wordmarks or product replicas
- [ ] Lighthouse: Perf ≥ 85, A11y ≥ 95, BP ≥ 95
- [ ] OG image (Field mode, Cutaway, ×1000), meta tags, favicon, noscript
- [ ] Deploy (Vercel / Netlify / Cloudflare Pages)
- [ ] Record a 20–30 s capture for the launch post: slow-mo field → Launch → swap to Induction (slip) → Top speed (field weakening) → Regen

---

## Stretch ideas (after launch)
- [ ] Second scene "Skateboard": EV chassis with a structural battery, 3 motors and torque vectoring in a turn
- [ ] Switched reluctance motor as a third rotor option
- [ ] Demagnetization demo: overheat the magnets and watch the torque constant drop permanently (with a reset)
- [ ] Cogging torque: turn the magnet rotor by hand (drag) and feel the notches (haptic-like snapping)
- [ ] Efficiency-map "drive cycle": replay a WLTP cycle as a dot cloud on the map

## Time estimate
≈ 45–50 hours of focused work, or about 17 Opus sessions (Phases 1 and 8 may take two sessions each).
